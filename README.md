# Simple_Weather_App
Hello everyone, 
I created a weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I tried to keep it as simple as possible using the basic coding structure for better readability and understanding for beginners. 
I am also in a learning phase hence mistakes are very much possible, feedbacks are most welcome.
Feel free to check my work and if you have any suggestions on how to make the code more simpler, don't hesitate to suggest. 
Thanks !!!
